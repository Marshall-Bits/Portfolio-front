# Marshall-Bits portfolio

First of all, can I call this a portfolio?
To be honest, I don't think so ðŸ˜…
The project started when I wanted to create something special, something that I could call my own, that has a few things that I like and that I could use to show a bit of my skills.

I really like pixel art, so I decided to create a pixel art character that represents me, and I thought it would be cool to create the page in a pixel art style as well.

I used React to create the page and aseprite to create the pixel art.
All the images were created by me.
